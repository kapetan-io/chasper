# 3. Adopt React Native

Date: 2025-06-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Chasper requires a multi-platform UI solution that can deliver high performance
across mobile (iOS/Android) and web platforms while maintaining code
reusability and developer productivity.

We need a technology stack that supports:
- Cross-platform development to reduce maintenance overhead
- High-performance real-time messaging interfaces
- Extensive component ecosystem for rapid development
- Strong community support and long-term viability

## Decision

We will adopt React and React Native as our primary UI development framework
for both mobile and web applications.

### Primary Reasons

#### Meta's Strategic Investment in React Native Performance
- Facebook/Meta is heavily investing in React Native performance improvements
for their VR headsets and metaverse initiatives
- The New Architecture (Fabric + TurboModules) provides significant performance improvements
- Hermes JavaScript engine optimizations specifically target mobile performance
- Meta's long-term commitment ensures continued development and support

#### Wide Community Adoption
- React Native powers major applications including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Uber, Airbnb, and Discord
- Large active community with 100k+ GitHub stars and extensive Stack Overflow support
- Mature ecosystem with established best practices and tooling

#### Extensive Component Ecosystem
- Rich library of pre-built components and utilities
- React Native Elements, NativeBase, and other UI libraries
- Easy integration with web-based component libraries (shadcn/ui via React Native Web)
- Expo ecosystem providing additional native functionality

#### Technical Alignment with Project Goals
- "Learn once, write anywhere" philosophy aligns with our multi-platform requirements
- Code sharing between web (React) and mobile (React Native) reduces development overhead
- Hot reloading and fast refresh support rapid iteration
- TypeScript support enables type-safe development
- Integration with existing web technologies and build tools

#### Performance Capabilities
- Native bridge allows access to platform-specific optimizations
- Concurrent rendering and React 18 features improve responsiveness
- FlashList and other performance-optimized components support large chat histories
- WebRTC and real-time communication libraries readily available

## Consequences

- App store deployment complexities
- Performance limitations compared to fully native apps
- Developers need React Native-specific knowledge
- Navigation, state management, and platform APIs differ from web
- Build and deployment pipeline setup
- Large dependency tree and potential conflicts
- React Native version upgrades can be breaking
- Native module compatibility issues
- Bundle size considerations for performance
